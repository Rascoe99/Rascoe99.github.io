        <p> Hello my name is David Rascoe, I am a senior at the University of Rhode Island. I am taking this course to learn about code and how to build websites. I think this information can be really useful to me later in life. This is my first class and I am looking forward to learn all the basics of coding by the end of the semester. Thank you!!!
