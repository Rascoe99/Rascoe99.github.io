       <p>  Our game that we created called Bit is a fun and takes a little bit of creative thinking. As you start the game , you will be put in a beginner type level that you can get a "feel" for the game. You will use the arrow keys to move directions and the alt key to use the sword. Your mission is to survive and defeat the evils. After you defeat the beginner level, you will put in a more complicated level and then the last level is the boss level. To defeat the boss, you will need to figure out how to survive and destroy it's power source.
