                        Hello, My name is David Rascoe, I am senior finance major at the University of Rhode Island. My birthday is March 25, 1999 which makes me 21 years old. I enjoy watching and playing almost every sport. My favorite sports include basketball, football and even bowling!!!! Also I like to play poker. Before Covid happened and they shut down parts of the casinos, I used to go to Twin River and play there. I will go after the pandemic when they open poker back up. I do also want to play at foxwoods. An interesting fact about me is that when I was in High School, I had to transfer schools my senior year because my school got shut down. Im looking forward to my great future that lies ahead of me.
